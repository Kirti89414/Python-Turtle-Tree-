# Python-Turtle-Tree-
This project uses Python’s Turtle graphics library to generate a tree-like fractal structure. The turtle module allows drawing shapes and patterns by controlling a “pen cursor.” By using recursion, the program repeatedly draws smaller branches at different angles, which together form a tree structure.
